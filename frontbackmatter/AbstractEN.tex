	\chapter*{Abstract}
% This master's thesis explores the field of data storytelling applied to \\automotive-based data, exploring its potential for effectively communicating complex information. Through conducting an expert interview, insights from professionals in the industry were garnered to understand the challenges and opportunities associated with interpreting and presenting such data.\\\\
% The thesis presents a variety of implemented graphs based on the acquired insights, utilizing data storytelling techniques to transform the data into a comprehensible form. These visualizations aim not only to present information but also to narrate stories that enable users to better grasp underlying patterns and trends.\\\\
% Furthermore, a focal point of the thesis lies in trend detection tailored to the needs associated with automotive-based data. Leveraging TypeScript, a dynamic trend detection mechanism was implemented to automatically identify patterns and developments within the data, thereby aiding decision-making processes.\\\\
% This thesis contributes to deepening the understanding of applying data storytelling to automotive-based data and offers practical insights into the implementation of trend detection algorithms in TypeScript. The findings and insights provide a valuable contribution for professionals in the automotive industry as well as researchers and practitioners in the fields of data visualization and analysis.


This masterâ€™s thesis explores the field of data storytelling applied to \\automotive-based data, exploring its potential for effectively communicating complex information. Using multiple expert interviews, this study tries to gain insights from professionals in the car industry on which data is most importantly displayed.\\\\
The thesis presents a variety of implemented graphs based on the acquired insights, utilizing data storytelling techniques to transform the data into a simpler form. These visualizations not only show information but also tell stories to help users see patterns and trends more clearly.\\\\
Another important part of the thesis is finding trends in automotive-based data. Using TypeScript, a trend detection system was developed, which automatically finds patterns and changes in the data. This system is used to dynamically and directly display the most important developments in the data, which can help the decision-making process.\\\\
Overall, this thesis contributes to deepening the understanding of applying data storytelling and gives insights into the implementation of trend detection algorithms in TypeScript. The findings and insights provide a valuable contribution for professionals in the automotive industry as well as researchers and practitioners in the fields of data visualization and analysis.
